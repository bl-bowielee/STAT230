Conclusion
To conduct this analysis, we analyzed survey data from 32 students related to their weekly study habits, choice of school, semester credit loads, majors and GPAs. We further explored relationships between GPA and various factors using visualizations, such as histograms, scatterplots, and boxplots. We also found that study hours per week were highly variable, with most students studying in the range of 2–10 hours, but each category had almost equal number of representations. Out of these, only 6.3% stated that they studied more than 10 hours. The majority of students (65.6%) do not attend school for their major. Most students enrolled for 15 credits per semester, and Computer Science was the most popular major (28.1%). GPAs varied between 2.7 and 4.0, with the mode near 3.0–3.5.
The scatterplot GPA vs credits did not display a clear linear linearity which implies that the GPA doesn't strongly depend on credit load. The GPA histogram looked relatively uniform with a slight upward spike for GPAs over 3.5. The boxplot by major indicated that the majors Computer Science and Mathematics and Elementary Education had high GPAs with low variation, while Data Science had more variation in GPA. Summary statistics supported these observations, as Data Science functioned as the degree with the highest GPA range, while IT/MS Cybersecurity had the lowest average GPA at 2.7. In general, GPA is not much affected by number of credits or study time but there are some differences on major.
